## About me

I study computer science, with a major in statistics.

## Why blog?

1. I have read programming blogs for as long as I've been serious about programming. I have learned a lot from them, and deeply enjoyed reading them.
2. Writing is a skill that I'd like to be able to do easily. Not necessarily writing in great style, but being able to put any thought that I want to in writing without too much effort. Right now, that is not the case. I don't write much, and when I do, I agonize over every word. The inhibition threshold maintains itself because it keeps me from practicing writing regularly. It seems to me that there are 2 equilibria, and I hope that blogging can help me from number 1 to number 2:
    1. You write often &harr; Writing is low effort when you do write
    2. You write rarely &harr; Writing is strenuous when you do write
