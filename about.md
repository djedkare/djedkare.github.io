## About me

I study computer science, with a minor in statistics.

## Why blog?

1. I have read programming blogs for as long as I've been serious about programming. I have learned a lot from them, and deeply enjoyed reading them. Maybe I'll enjoy producing them as much as consuming them.
2. Writing is a skill that I'd like to be able to do easily. Not necessarily writing in great style, but being able to put any thought that I want to in writing without too much effort. Right now, that is not the case. I don't write much, and when I do, I agonize over every word. The inhibition threshold maintains itself as it keeps me from practicing my writing regularly. It seems to me that there are 2 equilibria, and I hope that blogging can help me go from number 1 to number 2:
    1. You write rarely &harr; Writing is strenuous when you do write
    2. You write often &harr; Writing is low effort when you do write
3. In art classes for beginners, they encourage you to keep every painting, so that later you'll be able to appreciate your progress. This is important, because we tend to forget about all the little things we used to struggle with, but overcame. Seeing just how far we've come along can be a great source of motivation, and that is of course also true in programming.
4. Hopefully, by showing my thoughts and code to the world I can get feedback on them.

That is, I don't necessarily write to educate nor think of myself as smarter than the reader. In particular, points 3 and 4 require taking care to mention all the things I struggled with while working on a post.
